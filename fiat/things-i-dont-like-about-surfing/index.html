            <p>Recently our fellow editor, NAME REDACTED, here at The Cabal took a vacation and tried out surfing. I myself find my work at The Cabal to be vacation enough, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>In either case, in an effort to create some kind of productive output from his traipsing about in tropical climes I decided to interview him about his experiences in taking up surfing, specifically all the things he didn&rsquo;t like about it. Here&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<ul>
<li>There have to be waves.</li>
<li>Paddling out is super tiring.</li>
<li>Paddling out is different than swimming.</li>
<li>You have to stop and rest and look around sometimes.</li>
<li>All the people, and they&rsquo;re not very considerate.</li>
<li>Asshole culture[?].</li>
<li>I cut up my feet really bad because of reefs.</li>
<li>I would do it again.</li>
</ul>
