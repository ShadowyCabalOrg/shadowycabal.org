<p>I worked at Facebook when covid first hit. Zuckerburg treated everyone in the company very, very well. There was a blanket &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about performance, take care of your families&rdquo; guarantee that honestly was an enormous help.</p>
<p>The thing that particularly struck me though was the way he handled contract workers like (some of) the kitchen staff, cleaners, etc. These people don&rsquo;t work for Facebook and he had zero obligation to them, yet he paid all of their wages for the full length of the pandemic just so they could stay afloat.</p>
<p>If it were just about the money, I doubt he&rsquo;d have done this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534423">alasdair_</a>.</em></p>
<p>As the owner of a successful small business, one which has sadly been through many hiring and firing booms, along with general productivity swings with changes in the macroeconomy, I can confirm that Mark Zuckerberg did not layoff 13% of his workforce at Meta for just &ldquo;the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure, cutting 13% of the workforce could be for any number of reasons floated by Meta over the last few days. It might be &ldquo;ghost workers,&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> idling do-nothings who take up precious space in the office (not to mention their burden on payroll and benefits, which we won&rsquo;t mention, because that wouldn&rsquo;t be a reason to fire them). It might even be in the messaging sent to employees: the cited &ldquo;capital efficiency&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (which again, has nothing to do with money, but is instead about <a href="/img/capital-cover.jpg"><em>capital</em></a>, which is very different) including freezing discretionary spending and boasting about reducing perks.</p>
<p>More <em>realistic</em> reasons for layoffs at a publicly-traded company with lowered earnings estimates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a case of the Mondays</li>
<li>he stubbed his toe</li>
<li>bad gas</li>
<li>countering hustle porn</li>
<li>so they would have time to have a catch with children</li>
<li>they owned shares of Hawaiian land<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li>gender dysphoria</li>
<li>woke leftists</li>
</ul>
<p>My theory: the arrival of winter bringing a desire to usher all of the <del>ants</del> workers towards their cold deaths (because it&rsquo;s fun!).</p>
